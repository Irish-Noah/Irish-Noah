# Welcome To My Profile!  
My name is Noah, but everyone online just calls me Irish. I am a junior at Michigan State Universtiy majoring in Computer Science. After I graduate, I want to work with machine learning to help develop AI! 

I like to edit videos and learn about space in my spare time

There isn't much yet, but go ahead and check out some of my projects if you like!
